#### How to run this app locally

1.`$ npm install`  
2.`$ npm start`

#### Design decisions

1. Sketched the UI where the attribute can be added and edited separately without the need to click on nodes and save each change
2. You can zoom in and out, or move the canvas
3. Used React-Konva; it is a JavaScript library for drawing complex canvas graphics

#### HighLights

1. Did not have the time to make a save and load buttons for the created structures using redux
2. Did not clean the whole logic but I have put the uncleaned logic in the same file to optimize later

#### Lessons learned

- It is been a while since I last used ReactJS classes, considering the components tree and avoiding props drilling were fun to deal with again.
- I really enjoyed the fact that this project has a lot of scenarios that you can not realize until you start coding
